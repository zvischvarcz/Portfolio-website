                    <p>Hello, I'm Zvi Schvarcz, a motivated junior software developer based in Manchester, UK. My journey into the world of coding began after spending 3 Â½ years as a sales assistant. Seeking a new challenge, I decided to take the leap and transition into software development, joining <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" className="codenationLink">Code Nation.</a></p><br/>

                <div className="aboutPagePWrap">
                
                    <p>I embarked on this exciting journey with the Software: Develop 3-week course, where I mastered the basics of HTML, CSS, and Python. Together with my talented cohort, we created an intriguing in-terminal RPG using Python, which you can explore on the <Link className="codenationLink" to="/projects">projects</Link> page.</p>

                    <p>Eager to expand my skillset, I enrolled in the Master: Software 12-week bootcamp. Here, I delved deeper into HTML and CSS, was introduced to JavaScript, React, and the world of API integration. The front-end development part of the course was immensely gratifying.</p>

                    <p>The back-end was equally intriguing, as I tackled Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, SQL, Sequelize, and the art of connecting front-end and back-end seamlessly.</p><br/>
